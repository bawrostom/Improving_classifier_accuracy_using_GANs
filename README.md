This project is about designing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that classifies a dataset of horses and cows. Firstly, we will design and train the model using the given dataset. Then, we will use GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) to generate additional images. Finally, we will train the model with the augmented data to improve accuracy. 
Data folder contains training and testing data as follows:
Newdata: contains the initial training and testing data total of 82 sample
Generated: contains Cow and Horse images of generated by GANs total of 1050 sample
myNewdata: is the collection of generated and initial training samples for training and initial testing samples
